# Ready to Surf and Chillax with W.Avy at his ice cream  surf shop???

## Dude, this is going to be cool Pura Vida all year long!

W.Avy asked me to analyze temperatures in Hawaii all year long. I used Python, Pandas functions and SQLAlchemy and focused on the summer month of June and winter in December.
Aloha! Paradise is consistent!

* Overview of *June* in Hawaii Analysis
Of 1700 temperature readings observed in the months of June from 2010 to 2017 
the average temperature is *74.9* degrees Fahrenheit with a standard deviation of 3.3 degrees.

* June Maximum Temp is 85° F

* June Mininum Temp is 64° F


* Overview of *December* in Hawaii Analysis
Of 1517 temperature readings observed in the months of December from 2010 to 2016 
the average temperature is *71°* degrees Fahrenheit with a standard deviation of 3.7 degrees.

* December Maximun Temp is 83° F

* December Mininum Temp is 56° F

### The differences in mininum observed temperatures offer the greatest range of 8° F.

### The average temperatures observed from June to December vary <5° F.

### The maximum observed temperatures differ just two degrees from 85° in June to 83° in December. 



Overall I do think that the need for ice cream may stay in season for W.Avy with the greatest
temperature variance being only 8 degrees possible. The Hawaii sqlite not only offers a 
database of temperature readings but also data of measured precipation and weather
station location data. I would suggest to W.Avy to continue delving into these two other 
queries to hone down to the perfect location for his shop on Hawaii. W.Avy may want a location
nearest the weather station that shows the least amount of yearly precipitation.
#### Too much rain might be a *WipeOut*.
