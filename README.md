# Ready to Surf and Chillax with W.Avy at his ice cream parlor surf shop???

## Dude, this is going to be cool, all year long!

W.Avy asked me to analyze temperatures in Hawaii all year long. I used Python, Pandas functions and SQLAlchemy and focused on the summer month of June and winter in December.
Aloha! Paradise is consistent!
